The `TableNamingCheck` class is designed to enforce specific naming conventions for database table names in PL/SQL. The logic and conditions embedded in this class are:

1. **Logger Setup**: A logger is set up for the class, facilitating the logging of information, warnings, and other messages.
2. **Regular Expression for Table Name**: The `TABLE_PATTERN` is defined to match table names that:
    - Begin with 2 or 3 alphanumeric characters, followed by an underscore.
    - Followed by a sequence of alphanumeric characters or underscores.
    - Mandatorily end with `_TN`.

3. **Valid Prefixes**: A set of valid prefixes is defined which indicates permissible beginnings for table names.
4. **Initialization and Subscription**: Upon initialization, the rule subscribes to nodes of type `CREATE_TABLE`. This ensures that whenever a `CREATE_TABLE` node is encountered in the codebase, the rule's `visitNode` method will be triggered.
5. **Node Visitation Logic**: Upon visiting a node:
    - The table name is extracted, converted to uppercase, and evaluated.
    - Table names starting strictly with `JSR` or `JSD` are prohibited.
    - Table names exceeding 30 characters in length are flagged.
    - Table names not starting with a valid prefix are flagged.
    - Table names not following the specific naming conventions are flagged.

6. **Naming Convention Checks**:
    - If a table name starts with `TMP_`, it must end with `_TEMP` or `_TMP`.
    - Table names ending with `_GTT`, `_MV`, `_TEMP`, or `_TMP` are accepted even without the `_TN` suffix.
    - All other table names must adhere to the `TABLE_PATTERN` regex, meaning they should end with `_TN`.

In essence, the class enforces the following:
- Table names should start with a valid prefix.
- They should not start with `JSR` or `JSD`.
- Their length shouldn't exceed 30 characters.
- All table names (except for exceptions) should end with `_TN`.
- Exceptions are those ending with `_GTT`, `_MV`, `_TEMP`, `_TMP`, or starting with `TMP_`.
