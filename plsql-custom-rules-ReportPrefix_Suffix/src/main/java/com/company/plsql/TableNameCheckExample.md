## SQL File Explanation

1. **Tables with Prohibited Prefixes JSR and JSD**
    - `JSR_INVALID_TABLE_TN` and `JSD_ANOTHER_INVALID_TABLE_TN` have names starting with `JSR` and `JSD`, respectively, which are prohibited.

2. **Tables Without Valid Prefixes and Not Following Naming Conventions**
    - `INVALID_NAME`, `DATA_DESCRIPTION_TABLE`, `XYZ_ANOTHER_INVALID_TABLE`, `TEST_WRONG_NAME`, `INVALIDNAME`, `INVALID_NAME_WITHOUTPREFIX`, `INVALIDNAME_TN`, `IN1VALID_NAME`, and `XYZ` don't start with any of the valid prefixes. Additionally, they don't adhere to the specified naming conventions.

3. **Tables Exceeding Maximum Length**
    - `TMP_INVALID_TABLE_INVALID_TABLE_INVALID_TABLE_TN` has a name that exceeds the maximum allowed character length.

4. **Tables Starting with "TMP_" but not Adhering to TMP Specific Rules**
    - `TMP_INVALID_ENDINGNAME_ABC` starts with `TMP_` but doesn't end with either `_TEMP` or `_TMP` making it non-compliant.
    - `TMP_TEMPORARY_GTT` also begins with `TMP_`, but it ends with `_GTT`, which doesn't align with the rule's requirements for tables starting with `TMP_`.

This summarizes the non-compliant table names in the provided SQL file based on the specified rule logic.
